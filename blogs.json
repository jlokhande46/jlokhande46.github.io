They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king\u2019s justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran\u2019s\u00a0life.</p>\n<p>The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall. It made Bran\u2019s skin prickle to think of it. He remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and slayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible half-human children.</p>\n<p>But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king\u2019s justice was old and scrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed all in black, the same as a brother of the Night\u2019s Watch, except that his furs were ragged and\u00a0greasy.</p>\n<p>The breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them. Robb and Jon sat tall and still on their horses, with Bran between them on his pony, trying to seem older than seven, trying to pretend that he\u2019d seen all this before. A faint wind blew through the holdfast gate. Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of Winterfell: a grey direwolf racing across an ice-white field.</p>\n<p>Bran\u2019s father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father\u2019s face, Bran thought, and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell.</p>\n<p>There were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning, but afterward Bran could not recall much of what had been said. Finally his lord father gave a command, and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square. They forced his head down onto the hard black wood. Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth the sword. \u201cIce,\u201d that sword was called. It was as wide across as a man\u2019s hand, and taller even than Robb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian\u00a0steel.</p>\n<p>His father peeled off his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel, the captain of his household guard. He took hold of Ice with both hands and said, \u201cIn the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, I do sentence you to die.\u201d He lifted the great sword high above his\u00a0head.</p>\n<p>Bran\u2019s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. \u201cKeep the pony well in hand,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd don\u2019t look away. Father will know if you\u00a0do.\u201d</p>\n<p>Bran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away.<br>His father took off the man\u2019s head with a single sure stroke. Blood sprayed out across the snow, as red as summerwine. One of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting. Bran could not take his eyes off the blood. The snows around the stump drank it eagerly, reddening as he\u00a0watched.</p>\n<p>The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy\u2019s feet. Theon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head,and kicked it\u00a0away.</p>\n<p>\u201cAss,\u201d Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran\u2019s shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard\u00a0brother.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou did well,\u201d Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at\u00a0justice.</p>\n<p>It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky. Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main party, his pony struggling hard to keep up with their\u00a0horses.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe deserter died bravely,\u201d Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother\u2019s coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. \u201cHe had courage, at the\u00a0least.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jon Snow said quietly. \u201cIt was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his eyes, Stark.\u201d Jon\u2019s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and\u00a0fast.</p>\n<p>Robb was not impressed. \u201cThe Others take his eyes,\u201d he swore. \u201cHe died well. Race you to the\u00a0bridge?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDone,\u201d Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they\u00a0went.</p>\n<p>Bran did not try to follow. His pony could not keep up. He had seen the ragged man\u2019s eyes, and he was thinking of them now. After a while, the sound of Robb\u2019s laughter receded, and the woods grew silent\u00a0again.</p>\n<p>That was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them. He waved and shouted down at them. <em>\u201cFather, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!\u201d</em> Then he was gone\u00a0again.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3ed25e8c0e2e\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<p>The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer.
